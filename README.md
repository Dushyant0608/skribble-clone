## 📌 Overview

**Skribbl Clone** is a real-time multiplayer drawing and guessing game. Players join a room via a 6-character code, take turns drawing a chosen word, and race to guess what others are drawing. Points are awarded for correct guesses — the fastest guesser scores highest. Built end-to-end with a Socket.io event-driven architecture and an HTML5 Canvas drawing engine with real-time stroke sync.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Frontend (React + Vite)          Backend (Node.js + Express)
        |                                    |
        |     WebSocket (Socket.io)          |
        |◄──────────────────────────────────►|
        |                                    |
   socket.js                        GameManager.js
   App.jsx                          Room.js
   pages/                           words.js
   components/
```

**No database** — all game state is held in two Maps on the server:
- `rooms Map` → roomId → Room object
- `socketToRoom Map` → socket.id → roomId
